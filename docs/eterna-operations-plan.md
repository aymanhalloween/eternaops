## Enhanced Data Model

### Simplified Data Model (As Designed)
```sql
-- Core entities for streamlined operations
retirement_homes(id, name, contact_info)
residents(id, home_id, name, background_notes, progress_status)
interviews(id, resident_id, file_url, transcript_text, status)
chapters(id, resident_id, title, content, order, status)
exports(id, resident_id, type, file_url, created_at)
```

### Extended Data Model (For Future Implementation)
```sql
-- Additional entities for enhanced workflow management
projects(id, resident_id, status, start_date, target_completion)
team_assignments(id, resident_id, storyteller_id, writer_id, editor_id)
chapter_versions(id, chapter_id, editor_id, diff, created_at)
notifications(id, user_id, type, message, read_status, created_at)
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **Account Dashboard**: Select Retirement Home â†’ Resident
2. **Resident Profile**: All details, progress, and tools in one place
3. **Upload Hub**: Drag-drop audio/transcript uploads
4. **Chapter Pipeline**: Draft â†’ Review â†’ Approve â†’ Export workflow
5. **Export Center**: Generate books, podcasts, newsletters on-demand

## Key Design Principles

### Interface Design Philosophy
- **Minimal, clean interface** focused on core workflow
- **Consistent shadcn component usage** throughout the application
- **Fast loading with optimistic updates** for responsive user experience
- **Clear visual hierarchy and progress indicators** for immediate status understanding
- **Mobile-responsive design** for tablet use during interviews

### Operations-First Approach
The platform prioritizes operational efficiency over automation:
- Manual quality control at every step
- Human oversight for story authenticity
- Team collaboration tools for smooth handoffs
- Progress tracking for accountability
- Analytics-driven dashboard for actionable insights

### Professional Interface Standards
- Clean, modern interface using shadcn/ui components
- Slate-700 color scheme for professional appearance
- Responsive design optimized for internal team workflows
- Consistent design patterns throughout

### Scalability Considerations
- Modular component architecture for easy extension
- Database design supports multiple retirement communities
- Team assignment system scales with growing staff
- Export system handles multiple output formats

## Implementation Phases
